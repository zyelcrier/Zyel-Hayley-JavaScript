3 3/4 cups AP Flour
3 tablespoons Dutch processed cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 1/4 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cups vegetable oil
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon red food coloring
1 1/2 cups buttermilk, at room temperature

FROSTING:
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
1/2 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups superfine sugar



DIRECTIONS

1) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
   Butter and flour 2 (9-inch) cake pans and line each pan with a round of parchment paper.
2) Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.
3) Cream the butter, sugar and oil in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. 
   Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl and beat until incorporated. 
   Beat in the vanilla, vinegar and food coloring.
4) Add the flour mixture to the batter in 3 batches alternating with the buttermilk, mixing well after each addition. 
   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center
   comes out with a few moist crumbs. Cool on a baking rack for 15 minutes before removing the cake from the pans. 
   Let cool completely before frosting. Slice each cake into 2 layers and frost.
FROSTING:
5) Combine the cream, milk, vanilla bean and seeds in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. 
   Remove the vanilla bean and discard. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened to a paste, about 2 minutes. 
   Scrape into a bowl, cover and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 hours.
6) Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat until the mixture is 
   very fluffy and the sugar is totally dissolved, about 6 minutes. Add the cold paste, a few tablespoons at a time to the butter mixture and 
   whip until light and fluffy.

ID: 002, COOKIES & CREAM ICE CREAM CAKE RECIPE

INGREDIENTS

CAKE:
1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, softened
2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups (437 grams) cake flour
1 Tablespoon (15 grams) baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 cup (227 grams) whole milk
3/4 cup chopped Oreo cookies
8 large egg whites (240 grams), room temperature

REMAINING COMPONENTS:
1.5 quarts Cookies and Cream ice cream, softened (store bought or homemade)
2 cups whipped cream, or store-bought whipped topping
additional chopped Oreo cookies, to garnish


DIRECTIONS

CAKE:
1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter half sheet pan (18x13-inch) and line with parchment paper. Set aside.
2) In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream together butter, sugar, and vanilla until smooth and fluffy.
3) In a separate bowl, whisk together cake flour, baking powder, and salt. 
   With the mixer running on low, add flour mixture in three additions alternating with milk. Start and finish with flour mixture. 
   Scrape down bowl as needed to ensure thorough mixing. Fold in chopped Oreo cookies.
4) In a large clean bowl, whip egg whites using an electric hand mixer. Start at low speed until egg whites are foamy. 
   Increase speed and continue to whip to stiff peaks. Gently fold egg whites into cake batter in three additions. 
   Cake batter will loosen as you add the egg whites.
5) Transfer cake batter to prepared sheet pan. Spread into an even layer. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating pan midway through baking, 
   until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean. 
6) Allow cake to cool to room temperature in pan. Use a mini offset spatula or butter knife to loosen cake from pan. 
   Use a 9-inch parchment round as a guide to cut out one layer of cake. Fold parchment round in half and cut out two half rounds using remaining cake.  
   Immediately use cakes for assembly, or wrap in plastic wrap for later use.

ASSEMBLY:
1) Line 9-inch springform pan with plastic wrap, making sure to cover up the sides. If desired, place a 9-inch cake board at the bottom of the pan.
2) Place the two half round cake pieces at the bottom of the pan. Spread softened ice cream on top of cake. 
   Top with remaining cake round. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the freezer overnight to set up.
3) Remove ice cream cake from pan. Top with whipped cream. Garnish with additional chopped Oreo cookies. 
   Allow ice cream cake to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
